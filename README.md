# EnvSanityCheck
A minimal, multi-language compatible Python CLI tool to validate environment configuration. It ensures all required variables (listed in env.spec) are present and non-empty in your .env or system environment, preventing deployment errors caused by missing keys. Essential for team onboarding and reliable project setup.
